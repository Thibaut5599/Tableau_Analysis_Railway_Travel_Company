# Tableau_Analysis_Railway_Travel_Company

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze a set of data to participate in the creation of a (fictitious) start-up by a company specializing in train travel reservations.

One has access to a dataset containing valuable information about countries, including gross domestic product (GDP), extent of railway infrastructure, ease of doing business, etc.

The goal is to use this data to make a data-driven recommendation as to which country the company should choose to launch its startup.

It is important to take into account different factors that can influence the success of the business.
- Should we give priority to a country with a high GDP or a country where it is easy to do business ?
- How might the presence of railways and the number of passengers affect the business ?
- How important is the number of incoming international visitors ?

The team reported the following factors, in order of importance :
1. Current usage of the existing railways.
2. Total length of existing railways.
3. GDP per capita.
4. Ease of conducting business.

## Objective 
Define the country that the company should choose to launch its startup.
