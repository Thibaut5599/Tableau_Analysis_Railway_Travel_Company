# Tableau Analysis Railway Travel Company

This project was followed as part of the Coursera training [Tableau Business Intelligence Analyst Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tableau-business-intelligence-analyst?) during the eighth course entitled "Communicating Data Insights with Tableau". It's a guided project whose main purpose is to do data analysis only with Tableau (from data preparation to reporting via a Tableau story).


## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze a set of data to participate in the creation of a (fictitious) start-up by a company specializing in train travel reservations.

One has access to a dataset containing valuable information about countries, including gross domestic product (GDP), extent of railway infrastructure, ease of doing business, etc.

The goal is to use this data to make a data-driven recommendation as to which country the company should choose to launch its startup.

It is important to take into account different factors that can influence the success of the business.
- Should we give priority to a country with a high GDP or a country where it is easy to do business?
- How might the presence of railways and the number of passengers affect the business?
- How important is the number of incoming international visitors?

The team reported the following factors, in order of importance:
1. Current usage of the existing railways.
2. Total length of existing railways.
3. GDP per capita.
4. Ease of conducting business.

## Objective 
Define the country that the company should choose to launch its startup.

## Project Contents 
- **Dataset:** XLSX file (World_Development_Indicators.xlsx).
- **Tableau Story:** Story_RailwayTravelCompany.twbx is a presentation of analysis and results.
- **Tableau Dashboard:** Dashboard_RailwayTravelCompany.twbx is an interactive dashboard for exploring the data in more depth.

## Results and Conclusion
After analyzing key factors such as railway usage, infrastructure extent, GDP per capita, and business environment, France stands out as the most promising country to establish the new rail travel company. With high passenger volume, extensive rail lines, a strong economy, and business-friendly conditions, France offers the ideal balance for growth. Its location also facilitates international expansion, and its status as a top tourist destination presents a lucrative market for rail travel.
